Cromite are Bromite fork with ad blocking and privacy enhancements. This repo are inspired from [uazo/cromite](https://github.com/uazo/cromite) and it's for Windows build with installer.
Remember, this repo are unofficial and doesn't support by owner itself. But Cromite on Windows I had distribute are good to use. You can update to newest build by download the latest on releases and overwrite existing installation. Don't worry, it couldn't delete your existing browser data, unless you uninstall it.
